        Fullstack Developer with over 800 hours of practice in SoyHenry.
        Troughout these 800 hours of practice i have gotten the chance to not
        only learn new tecnologies but also build an indivitual project and a
        group project in wich i learned to work in a organized team. Before
        diving into web developement i worked constriction whith concrete and
        farming in wich i have learned the value of hardwork and consistency,
        beeing able to work in a team of people with the same goal. thats exacly
        what i expect to find in web development to be part of a bigger goal and
        have the sattisfiyng feeling of getting the job done.
